# Projeto-Natal

This was my course project in systems development 1;

A very simple project, but for the level of knowledge at the time it was a little tiring to do;

Using php and css I made this site that with some images already saved in the database I chose a christmas card 
and sent a message with it, the two were saved in the same table and presented together on the screen, they were not the same "file",
but I was able to present the two on screen together;

It hasn't been fully finished yet, but I intend to finish it;
